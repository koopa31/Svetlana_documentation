Welcome to Svetlana's documentation!
===================================

**Svetlana** is a Napari plugin developed in Python, dedicated to the classification of segmentation masks. It has mainly been developed for biological imaging, but it can be applied to any kind of segmented image.

The classifier is based on light-weight convolutional neural networks and is efficient with few annotations.
